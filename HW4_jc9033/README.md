# Homework 3
Individual work by Junjie Cai

## Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.
1. Generate a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared and a exponential distribution.
2. Calculate and plot the distribution of means with different sample size of each distribution in a scatter plot and a histogram.
3. Describe the behavior in the plots in terms of the law of large numbers or Central Limit Theorem.
4. Plot the distributions of all sample means (together for all distributions).
5. Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means.

## Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.
1. State the question and formulate the Null and Alternative hypothesis, and assign a significance level.
2. Download the data within the notebook and store the data in PUIDATA and read the data.
3. Display the top few rows of the DF
4. Display the reducted dataframe
5. Plot the number of trips in Long Duration & Short Duration.
6. Add the statistical errors in the figure.
7. Normalize the distribution of trips.

## Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook .
1. State and formulate the Null and Alternative hypothesis and assign a significance level.
2. Generate a list of random data to simulate the circulation time of origianal bus route and plot them in a histogram.
3. Download the new bus route data within the notebook and read the data and plot them in a histogram.
3. Calculating the Z-statistic.
4. Draw a conclusion based on the result.
