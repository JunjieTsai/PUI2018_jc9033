Assignment 2

Work in group of 2 with Junjie Cai (jc9033)

The three tests we choose: t-Test, Correlation and Logistic Regression. 


| **Statistical Analyses**	|  **IV(s)**  |  **IV type(s)** |  **DV(s)**  |  **DV type(s)**  |  **Control Var** | **Control Var type**  | **Question to be answered** | **_H0_** | **alpha** | **link to paper**|

Correlation	| 1, Riders' hand position | 1, categorical | 1, Horses' neck position| categorical | 1, Riders' rein length 2, Riders' heel height | 1, categorical 2, categorical |	Number of horses with high, round, or hollow neck position when riders spent more time with low hands positions is significantly higher than the control group | Number of horses of test group <= Number of control group | 0.01 | [Human Direct Actions May Alter Animal Welfare, a Study on Horses (Equus caballus)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010257) |
Logistic Regression | 1, waist-to-height ratio | Continuous | 1, morbidity of hypertension | Continuous | N/A | N/A | Do the hypertension morbidity of people who has higher waist-to-height ratio(WHtR) significantly higher than the hypertension morbidity of people who has lower waist-to-height ratio(WHtR) | (morbidity of WHtRâ‰¥0.5) <= (morbidity WHtR <0.5) | 0.05 | [Waist-to-Height Ratio and Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Chinese Adults in Beijing](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069298) |
