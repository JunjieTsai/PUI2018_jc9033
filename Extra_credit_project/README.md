## The relationship between the Traffic Layout Mode and the Public Service Layout Mode of Manhattan
Individul work by Junjie Cai<br> 

What are the critical factors that affect the public service layout pattern? In general idea, it is traffic, economy, population and other factors that affect the layout of urban public services. This analysis is designed to explore how the traffic layout mode relates to public service layout mode in Manhattan. The hypothesis is: the public service layout mode is correlated with the traffic layout mode in Manhattan, NYC. In terms of quantitative indicators: the distribution of POI is used to indicate the public service layout mode; the distributions of bus stations and subway stations are used to indicate the traffic layout mode. In conclusion, strong consistency and spatial correlation are shown between the traffic layout mode and the public service layout mode of Manhattan. The city central districts are the common center for the public service facilities and traffic stations. And they essentially have a strong connection. The research results can not only provide a basic theory for urban development but also interprets the mechanism of urban structure generation and provide theoretical support for urban land use and planning layout and population policy.<br>
